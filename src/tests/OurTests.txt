For Doors, I tested various situations.
I tested the common "is it facing the proper direction".
Some Doors are on corners, but open one way.
Some doors are side by side and facing the same direction.
There is one room where there are two doors that opens up and two doors that open down.
I also checked if a cell was called a door.

For the Legend, I tested the first and last element.
I also tested the longest value and a value with a symbol in case syntax might throw it off.
I checked to make sure a cell outside the range isn't a door/cell.
